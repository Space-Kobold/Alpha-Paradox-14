## About Alpha Paradox

AlphaParadox is a fork of [space-wizards/space-station-14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) ("Space Station 14"), focused on creating a more immersive experience through longer rounds and a focused design direction.

Space Station 14 itself is a C# remake of Space Station 13, which uses the custom [space-wizards/RobustToolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) ("RobustToolbox" or "RT") game engine.
