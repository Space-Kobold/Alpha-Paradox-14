- The CA only applies to *your original contributions*, not works submitted under an approved license or other negotiated license.
- You have a legal right to attribution (moral rights) in the credits of the project, please tell us if you wish to opt out of being displayed in the credits or wish to use an alternative name.
- If you patent or have patented any parts of your contribution, you give us the right to those use those patents in respect to the project.
- As much as possible, you are protected from legal liability for contributing (This does not protect you against copyright infringement liability).

# Licensing/Attribution:
- Unless specified otherwise, all Source Code, inside any **\_AlphaParadox, AlphaParadox, or \_APCore folders**, fall under the terms specified in AP-LICENSE.txt *with Exhibit B enforced* and the [Space Kobold Games CLA](https://gist.github.com/SpaceKoboldGames/a8f6b7a7d272cf949c60e0822cdf226e). All assets/content in those folders fall under CC-BY-SA 4.0.
- Any content from SpaceWizards/SpaceStation14 without specified licensing of any code is licensed under MIT (LICENSE.txt). Any Space Wizards content licensed under CC-BY-SA to Space Wizards Federation & Contributors.
- __**You may not apply secondary licenses to SpaceKobolds/AlphaParadox code/content (MPL Exhibit-B). If you wish to use our code/content with a secondary license while migrating away from GPL, please contact us and we may grant you a separate license. This is to make sure that Alpha-Paradox's code is available to be improved by the community and prevent fragmenting the community due to license conflicts.**__
- **We are in the process of removing/replacing content that is currently not under an approved license.**
- All code submitted by you where you hold the right to do so will be licensed under MPL 2.0 *with Exhibit B* to Space Kobold Games under the terms of the CLA, you still retain the rights and ownership of your contribution.

# Approved licenses:
The following licenses are permitted to be used in this project if you are not the original copyright owner:
- The following Creative Commons 4.0 (or later) licenses: [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.en), [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode.en), CC-[BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/legalcode.en),(ND licenses are discouraged, but accepted) or an earlier version with *permission from the author*.
- [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/MIT)
- [Mozilla Public License v2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/), ideally *with* Exhibit B (No secondary licenses).
- Public domain content under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), etc. NOTE: The absence of a copyright mark means **all rights reserved** *not* public domain, public domain must be explicitly marked/stated. Attribution is still required for public domain works.
### Specifically not allowed:
- Any "strong" Copyleft or GPL derivative licenses: GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL, etc. (This conflicts with the no secondary license provision of the MPL)
- Any license with strict or ambiguous non-commercial use limitations.
# Attribution/Sourcing Requirements:
- All assets *must* be properly licensed, attributed, and include the original title of the work. This also requires a link to the original author, and license and if needed provides a way to contact the author.
- For audio files especially: **you must find the actual author not just a YouTube channel**. <u>If you cannot find the author/original license you cannot use the asset.</u> Failure to be able to provide sourcing information will result in your PR being closed and potentially barring from future contributions depending on the severity of the situation.
- License versioning is important, make sure to include the correct version of the license in your attribution. If a version is not specified by the author with a versioned license, that is not a valid license and cannot be used.
- Most Assets have their license and the copyright in the metadata file. [Example](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/blob/master/Resources/Textures/Objects/Tools/crowbar.rsi/meta.json).
- "No Derivatives" licenses should be avoided if possible (but are permitted) as they can prevent fixing bugs or making for accessibility reasons (Color blindness or epilepsy fixes, etc.).
